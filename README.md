# React Portfolio

Hey there welcome to my React portfolio! I created this using a few different sources of inspiration, including some packages like animate.css, react-boostrap and a few others. This portfolio contains the most updated versions of my projects and links to my resume/Linkedin. This portfolio includes a few components, namely an 'about-me' / header, a project collection, a skills carousel and a small sample of my resume. The contact form currently does not work as this portfolio is a simple React page and not hosted by a server.

## Table of Contents
- [Usage/Examples](#usage)
- [Deployed Project](#deployed-project)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)


## Usage

Users can interact with the navbar to find the corresponding sections of my portfolio, as well as flip through my various skills/technologies in the skills-carousel. The contact form is currently a work in progress and will be updated later.
